Mycostr Protocol Specification
Protocol Overview
Mycostr combines three core technologies:

BitTorrent-style data distribution
Lightning Network payments
End-to-end encryption

Core Components
1. Storage Protocol
File Processing

Chunk size: 1MB default
Redundancy: Minimum 3 copies
Distribution: Geographic awareness
Verification: Proof of storage

Data Structure
File format:
file: {
id: "unique-identifier",
chunks: ["chunk-ids"],
size: "total-size",
created: "timestamp"
}
chunks: [{
id: "chunk-id",
index: "position",
hash: "verification-hash",
locations: ["node-ids"]
}]
2. Payment Protocol
Lightning Integration

Channel requirements: Minimum 100k sats
Payment frequency: Hourly
Rate calculation: Per GB stored
Auto-rebalancing: Every 24 hours

Payment Structure
Payment format:
payment: {
amount: "sats-per-hour",
channel: "channel-id",
for: "storage-id",
timestamp: "payment-time"
}
3. Network Protocol
Node Discovery

DHT-based peer finding
Geographic node mapping
Performance tracking
Reputation system

Data Routing

Dynamic path finding
Load balancing
Fault tolerance
Auto-recovery

Security Specifications
Encryption

Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
Key management: Per-file keys
Access control: Public key encryption
Forward secrecy: Key rotation

Verification

Chunk verification: Merkle proofs
Storage proofs: Random challenges
Payment verification: Lightning invoices
Node verification: Reputation-based
