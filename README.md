# Mycostr - Research & Exploration

## Overview
Exploring the intersection of BitTorrent-style distribution, Lightning Network payments, and Nostr's decentralized approach for sovereign data storage.

## Current Status: Research Phase
This repository is a collection of research, technical notes, and concept exploration for Bitcoin-native distributed storage. We're currently:
- Studying existing protocols
- Gathering community input
- Exploring technical challenges
- Documenting potential solutions

## Core Concepts Being Explored

### Distribution Model
- BitTorrent-style data distribution
- Resilient network patterns
- Efficient chunking and sharing
- Redundancy strategies

### Payment Architecture
- Lightning Network integration
- Storage provider incentives
- Pay-per-use models
- Automatic micropayments

### Sovereignty Layer
- User-controlled encryption
- No platform lock-in
- Full data ownership
- Simple, transparent protocol

## Areas for Discussion
- Lightning payment channel strategies for storage
- Efficient data distribution patterns
- Provider incentive structures
- Privacy and encryption approaches
